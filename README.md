# RCplane_v1

A rudimentary remote control plane using LoRa radios in order to learn how to make long range and reliable communication. 
This project serves to test my skills (having just finished the IO rocket project during my 2nd year at EPFL) but mainly I just really want an RC plane to be honest.
